YOLO Face Recognition using OpenCV  

Overview
This project uses the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection algorithm along with **OpenCV** to detect and recognize faces in real-time from images, videos, or webcam feeds. YOLO is a deep learning-based object detection model that can perform fast and accurate face recognition.  

Features  
‚úÖ Real-time face detection using YOLOv8  
‚úÖ Supports image, video, and webcam input  
‚úÖ Uses OpenCV for processing and display  
‚úÖ Fast and efficient detection  

Requirements  
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project.  

Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy pyyaml
```



How to Use

1Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Label Studio for Annotation
1. Open **Anaconda Prompt** and navigate to Label Studio:
   ```bash
   conda activate your_env_name  # Activate your Conda environment
   label-studio
   ```
2. Upload your dataset (images containing faces).
3. Annotate the images with the appropriate **face recognition classes**.
4. Export the labeled dataset in **YOLO format** (including `.txt` annotation files).
5. Save the exported dataset in the `datasets/` folder.

---

2Ô∏è‚É£ Train the YOLO Model in Google Colab
1. Open **Google Colab** and upload the **annotated dataset**.
2. Run `yolo_cv.py` to train the model:
   ```bash
   python yolo_cv.py --data datasets/ --epochs 50 --output my_model.pt
   ```
3. This script will train YOLO and generate the **trained model file (`my_model.pt`)**.

---

3Ô∏è‚É£ Execute YOLO Face Recognition Using Anaconda
1. Move the `my_model.pt` file to the **YOLO detection folder**.
2. Open **Anaconda Prompt** and navigate to the detection script:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/yolo_detection
   conda activate your_env_name
   ```
3. Run the **YOLO detection script (`yolo_detect.py`)**:
   ```bash
   python yolo_detect.py --model my_model.pt
   ```
4. The script will:
   - Open the webcam.
   - Recognize **faces based on the trained model**.
   - Display the live detection results.
   - 
Final Notes
- Label Studio is used for annotating images.
- Colab is used for training YOLO with the dataset.
- Anaconda + PyTorch + OpenCV is used for running the detection model on a local machine.

Code: detect_faces.py
```python
import cv2
import torch
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load YOLO model
model = YOLO("models/yolov8n.pt")  

# Load image
image = cv2.imread("images/sample.jpg")

# Run inference
results = model(image)

# Draw bounding boxes
for result in results:
    for box in result.boxes.xyxy:
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, box)
        cv2.rectangle(image, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Display image
cv2.imshow("YOLO Face Detection", image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

Future Improvements
üîπ Train a custom YOLO model for better accuracy  
üîπ Add face recognition (match detected faces with a database)  
üîπ Improve real-time performance for large-scale applications
